Hi! I'm **Davide**, a software engineer from Italy, who likes **building software and solve problems**... actually, most of the time, build software for solving problems (but there are also some exceptions (if you could see all my side projects and POC you would understand üòÖ)). 

I studied Computer Engineering at Universit√† degli studi di Roma Tre and I gratuated with a score of 110/100 cum laude. But you can find a lot of these informations on my CV or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davide-bersani-598158174/).

Anyway, I'm very interested in **software development** and **software architecture design**, and I like (try üòè) to do it in the right way. I love to study new technologies, design patterns, philosophies, frameworks, and especially I love to experiment with them. I also love to discuss about tech stuff, because I believe that the greatest teachings and ideas come from discussions and talks.

Currently, I'm working in Enel as a Data Engineer, I like my job and all the opportunities it gives to me!

Every day (not only for work) I play with technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Python, Java, Serverless tools and manage problems about orchestrate services and microservices, design API, design software architecture... and I love it! *(Did I already say that I love my job? )*

But technology is not my only passion. I'm a **Scout FSE**, and I'm very proud about my path. Thanks to this I lived wonderful experiences and allowed me to grow up with solid and good values.

How to not include my passion for **sport**! I love football, basket, padel, ping pong and I think any other kind of sport including a ball üòÑ

This website wants to be a place where I can collect interesting posts, projects and, why not, discuss with you about problems and solutions.
