👋🏻 Hi! I'm Davide, a Software Engineer from Italy, who likes building software and solve problems... actually, most of the time, build software for solving problems! (But there are also some exceptions (if you could see all my side projects and POC you would understand 😅)).

🚀 I'm very interested in software development and software architecture design, and I like (try 😏) to do it in the right way.

🔭 I love to study new technologies, design patterns, philosophies, frameworks, and especially I love to experiment with them.

💬 I also like to discuss about tech stuff, because I believe that the greatest teachings and ideas come from discussions and talks.

# Experience

## 👤 Data and Software Engineer
**📍 Enel Group, Rome, Italy**<br>
**🗓 November 2020 - Present**

**Overall**
- Engineering of AI models and data elaboration jobs, using Kubernetes, Docker, AWS serverless services (step functions, lambda, sagemaker), Python.
- Design and develop data pipelines
- Study state of the art tool for data management, like Apache Ariflow and Dagster.
- Monitoring of models and systems, applying major patterns like distributed tracing, log aggregation, metrics
- Development of dashboards and little frontends with Angular
- Design and developing of API, usually implementing a micro-services architecture
- Implement DevOps and MLOps pipelines to deploy industrialized AI and ML solutions
Following some specific projects I worked on

**Development of asynchronous REST API to expose inference endpoint with microservices and task queues**
Development of microservices that expose REST API to trigger inference. AI models are loaded dinamically into the microservices.<br>
Microservices developed in Python, using Flask (stack ngnix + uWSGI + Flask) and FastAPI (with uvicorn).<br>
Celery was used as task queue implementation, with SQS as broker.<br>
Deployed on Kubernetes.  <br>

**Monitoring of microservices application and AI model performances**
Implemented application monitoring for microservices application, with distributed tracing, log aggregation and metrics. Data exposed on CloudWatch with custom dashboards and log queries. CloudWatch alarms used to monitor status of microservices.

Designed and implemented a monitoring process for AI model performances. Data exposed on CloudWatch with custom dashboards. Possibility to set alarms on common models metrics (e.g. accuracy, f1-score).

**Development of backend REST API and contributed to development of validation dashboard**
Backend developed with FastAPI, exposes REST API. Integrated with DynamoDB.<br>
Contributed to the development of a dashboard for validating model's predictions, providing groundtruth. <br>
Developed with Angular. Deployed on Kubernetes.<br>

**Design and development of workflow for data pipelines**
Serveless solutions deployed on AWS.<br>
Workflow implemented with AWS StepFunctions. Steps developed with Lambda Functions or SageMaker Processing Job.<br>
Integrated with different types of sources: PostgreSQL, DynamoDB, Sharepoint.<br>

## 👤 Java Software Engineer
**📍 Exeest Inc. [https://exeest.com/](https://exeest.com/), Rome, Italy**<br>
**🗓 May 2020 - July 2020**
I designed and implemented ad architecture for business monitoring in a microservices architecture. (Spring, Kubernetes, Fluentd, EFK, MongoDB).<br>
This project is part of the work for my master degree.
- Experience with microservices architecture
- Monitoring microservices
- Monitoring the business trought monitoring patterns and tool (Application metrics, Log aggregation)
- Developed a microservice for query the monitored data and obtain business analytics.
- Experience with monitoring tools (EFK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana)

# Interests

I love to study new technologies, design patterns, philosophies, frameworks, and especially I love to experiment with them. I also like to discuss about tech stuff, because I believe that the greatest teachings and ideas come from discussions and talks.

But technology is not my only passion. I'm a Scout FSE, and I'm very proud about my path. Thanks to this I lived wonderful experiences and allowed me to grow up with solid and good values.

How to not include my passion for **sport**! I love football, basket, padel, ping pong and I think any other kind of team sport.
