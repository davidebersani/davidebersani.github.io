👋🏻 Hi! I'm Davide, a Software Engineer from Italy, who likes building software and solve problems... actually, most of the time, build software for solving problems! (But there are also some exceptions (if you could see all my side projects and POC you would understand 😅)).

🚀 I'm very interested in software development and software architecture design, and I like (try 😏) to do it in the right way.

🔭 I love to study new technologies, design patterns, philosophies, frameworks, and especially I love to experiment with them.

💬 I also like to discuss about tech stuff, because I believe that the greatest teachings and ideas come from discussions and talks.
